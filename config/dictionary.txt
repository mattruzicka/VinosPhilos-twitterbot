Political language... is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.
It is a truism that almost any sect, cult, or religion will legislate its creed into law if it acquires the political power to do so.
Political necessities sometime turn out to be political mistakes, as George has recently confirmed...
In our seeking for economic and political progress, we all go up - or else we all go down. It's actually not that difficult...
I am neither bitter nor cynical but I do wish there was less immaturity in political thinking.
The political function of rights is precisely to protect minorities from oppression by majorities (the smallest minority is the individual)
Individual rights are not subject to a public vote; a majority has no right to vote away the rights of a minority

History suggests that capitalism is a necessary condition for political freedom. Clearly it is not a sufficient condition.
The most perfect political community is one in which the middle class is in control, and outnumbers both of the other classes.
The basis of our political system is the right of the people to make and to alter their constitutions of government. So what went wrong?
