@ami_angelwings i hate this author.
@ami_angelwings where the hell did artificial insemination go. and how does she know she will get pregnant.
"you’ve burned 200 calories and added .001% muscle. “muscle adds curves, right, buddy?” she said, as she came to a stop.".

"the dot grew larger in her

it is better never to have been born. but who among us has such luck? one in a #million, perhaps.
"with each step she focused on a single image: a white dot on her forehead. safely mated, safely mated, she quietly repeated.".
"if eden weren’t careful she’d be just as skinny, and even less
desirable." oh okay, opposite world where being white and thin is oppression.
don't do the crime, if you can't do the time. -lt. col. ollie north.
"even at the age of seven, eden knew love was dead. only biological instinct and evolutionary climbing

maybe there is no death as we know it. just documents changing hands. #followback.
@ami_angelwings i once lived in a studio apartment that was 285 square feet. foyt probably doesn't know such things exist.
so, they force you to mate before you're 18 or you die b/c we need to repop the human race.  but you can only have 1 child.
"eden loved old tales about siblings. but one child was the allowable quota" wait.  what? they want you to reproduce but at a loss?
check my location tho...

just drove from #weha to winsted, ct out of sheer boredom... sheer boredom!! lol #winstedlifestyle.
like i know that it might be a small four rooms.  but that foyt thinks this is poverty is telling.
"the cramped four-room unit was too small for him. neither one of us fit, do we?" she's talking about her  her dog.  four rooms?
i suspect she intends the latter, while actually doing the former irl.
#comer uma mapn r mais eficiente que tomar cafr para se manter acordado. #teamfollowback.
that's either foyt being cognizant of her own racism or it's foyt implying that pocs fearing white racism is paranoid.
"she suspected that each and every coal passerby wanted to hurt her, though the statistical odds against that were high.".
i just can't tell which side of the door is laughing at me.
@ami_angelwings you may be the bravest person on twitter for reading through this and filtering it to all of us. thank you. (thank you?).

like for this super racist oppressive future, foyt can't seem to decide if intermarrying is banned or not...
when she says this, she's given official government docs on how to attract a mate. i thought they didn't want her to intermarry -_o.
#life is the childhood of our immortality. -goethe #followback.
"“because i don’t want my child to be all pearl. i’d rather be dead than mate with one of my kind.”" eden is such a wonderful person.
"her other vital statistics... were also listed, but nothing damned her more than being a pearl." is she the only 1 calling herself a pearl?
“@drugzarcolumbo: @yea_thats_him damn man throwing rocks at mailboxes, #wheredeydodatat” tomorrow i gotta do something über fun lol fuckkk.
"something she had dreaded almost as much as having

"her life-band flashed and eden’s official entry on the uni-gov mating site began to play." i guess forcible okcupid is kinda oppression xd.

this is a black "ethics officer" talking to eden.  why do black ppl want to continue the "white" race in reverse racism evil world?
“we cannot afford to supply precious resources to those who do not contribute to the continuation of our
species.” this makes no sense.
"“you’ll be eighteen years old on november 29... your basic resources will be stopped unless you mate?”" feb 29 birthdates are the luckiest.

@ami_angelwings for earth's sake. i must believe the third book will reveal it as satire and end with "fuck u stormfront" i really must.
the twist ending is that eden is actually a 21st century woman named victoria foyt  this is how she perceives the world. #savethewhites.
foyt needs to learn using terms like "half birthday" "for earth's sake" doesn't make her story any more futuristic sounding #savethewhites.
#tnt allows students the freedom to make mistakes.
"she flashed on the date: the 29th of may, her half birthday. for earth’s sake, how could she have
forgotten?" #ohgodthewriting.
@ami_angelwings happiness flew out to explore the galaxy after whistling "so long and thanks for all the fish?".
the attraction to "bad boys" is very rational.
so people do use "pc" language here... maybe it's just eden who can't stop referring to ppl by "slurs" xd #savethewhites.
patting each other's back culture.
"“eden lavinia newman, zone four, caucasian?” the officer said without great interest." apparently ppl who aren't eden don't use slurs.

raphael sadiq, who i like, thinks he has a little more prince in him than he actually does.
@ami_angelwings y'know, i always thought mallory archer was just a joke character, now i'm wondering if she's based on foyt.
you know, if you replace "coal" with "coon" or the n-word, i think we get the real gist of how foyt feels...
"i'll kiss you anywhere/yes love, even there".
"did the nosey bitch suspect..."  eden calls black women "bitch" or "coal bitch" a lot, but it's okay cuz she's oppressed #savethewhites.
this supersedes all previous notices. #teamautofollow.
"coals often killed pearls who seduced their kind." so why do any of them get white dots? -_o  i'm confused.  can they intermarry or not?
"took over bramford industries at age eighteen when his father died from a terrorist pearl attack." go heroic white terrorists!!!
